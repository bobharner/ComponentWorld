		<h2>About This Application</h2>

		<p class="greeting">
			In the past it was really hard to find good pre-built components for
			your Tapestry apps. Oh sure, you knew they were out there, somewhere.
			Internet searches always turned up a random smattering of
			components&#8212;sometimes just what you were looking for,
			but often not. And duplicates. Lots of duplicates. How
			can you know which one is best?</p>

		<p>Because it's so easy to write custom components in
			Tapestry, lots of people have published their first baby steps as
			mini-tutorials. The Tapestry Wiki is full of them, and some are very
			useful as components to paste into your app. But some aren't. How do
			you filter out the noise?</p>

		<p class="greeting">Some of the best sources for components are blogs.
			But you don't want to bookmark all of those blog entries just because
			they, for example, show you how to write a certain mixin that you
			may need <em>some day</em>. There's got to be a better way.</p>

		<p>
			Welcome to <b><em>${message:applicationName}</em></b>,
			a Java web application to help you find pre-built components for your
			Tapestry development projects.
		</p>

		<p class="greeting">The ${message:applicationName} database
			includes all of the built-in Tapestry components, of course.
			But it also lists every other known Tapestry 5-based
			component, mixin, module and framework out there.
			Even those recorded in wikis and blogs and tutorials.
			All tagged and categorized to make it easy to find what
			you're looking for.</p>
